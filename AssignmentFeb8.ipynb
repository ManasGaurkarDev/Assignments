    "Abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms and to create a boundary between the application and the client programs1.\n",
    "An example of abstraction is a car. A car has many internal components that work together to make it run, such as the engine, the transmission, the brakes, etc. However, when we use a car, we don’t need to know how these components work. We only need to know how to interact with the car through its interface, such as the steering wheel, the pedals, the buttons, etc. The car’s interface is an abstraction that hides the complexity of its implementation from us."

    "An example of abstraction and encapsulation is a bank account. A bank account has some data, such as balance, account number, etc., and some methods, such as deposit, withdraw, transfer, etc. The data and methods are encapsulated into a single class called BankAccount. The class has private fields and public methods to ensure data security and integrity. The class also implements an interface called Account that defines the abstract methods that any account should have. The interface is an abstraction that hides the implementation details of the bank account from the client programs. The client programs only need to know how to interact with the bank account through its interface, not how it works internally."

An anonymous class is a nameless class that extends or implements an abstract class or an interface. A lambda expression is a function without a name that can be used as an argument or a return value. Both anonymous classes and lambda expressions can provide implementations for the abstract methods and create instances of the abstract class on the fly. However, this technique may not be supported by all languages or may have some limitations."
